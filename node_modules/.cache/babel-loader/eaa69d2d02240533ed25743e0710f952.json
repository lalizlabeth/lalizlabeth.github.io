Some participants wanted to create guidelines for the set of shapes and were really bothered by the irregular blob. Other participants tried to create the most unique beautiful thing through breaking the system. Here is a compilation of some of their interactions:</p>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"col-5 medium-spacer-bottom video-wrapper\">\n          <iframe title=\"beauty-compilation-video\" className=\"project-image\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HIeOBNN2Kww\" autoplay=\"\" muted=\"\" loop=\"\"></iframe>\n        </div>\n\n        <p className=\"large-paragraph medium-spacer-bottom col-5\">At the end of day 2, there were over 100 different beautiful things in the gallery:</p>\n        <div className=\"col-5 medium-spacer-bottom\">\n          <img className=\"project-image\" alt=\"All beautiful things\" src={require(\"../assets/images/beauty/gallery.jpg\")}/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"text-group\">\n          <p className=\"large-paragraph medium-spacer-bottom col-5\">\n          I still need to analyze all the creations, but in general, people tended to want to get rid of the shapes that felt constraining: the large rectangle and the lopsided blob. I also created a process zine to showcase how my time at SFPC led me to create this project:</p>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"col-5 medium-spacer-bottom\">\n          <video className=\"project-image\" alt=\"Process book\" src={require(\"../assets/images/beauty/process-book.mov\")} autoPlay muted loop/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"text-group\">\n          <p className=\"large-paragraph medium-spacer-bottom col-5\">In the future, I hope to expand on this idea more to be about actual faces! I also hope to put the game online, so that people can interact with it outside of the showcase.</p>\n        </div>\n    </section>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Beauty;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
