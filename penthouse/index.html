        <h1 class="section-header">The Story Behind Penthouse</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="details">
        <p>Many hotel chains have loyalty programs to reward travelers who routinely stay with them. Penthouse aims to give these travelers a special, personalized experience.</p>

        <h3>Target Group</h3>
        <p>Our target users are frequent hotel stayers. These are some possible occupations that require traveling:</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Business People</li>
          <li>Globe Trotters</li>
          <li>Fashion Industry</li>
          <li>Reporters</li>
          <li>Consulting</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Initial Brainstorming</h3>
        <p>I tried to come up with different ways people define their own space. Most of the ideas fit into the category of aesthetics and taste. In a dorm room, for example, it's easy to define each roommate's personal space based on posters and photos.</p>
        <img src="images/brainstorm-1.JPG">

        <p>Based on these observations, I tried to come up with a few words that would capture the style, look, and feel of the entire experience. As the program would be a reward for frequent travelers, I thought that it should have a sense of luxury or exclusiveness. These words also led to the name Penthouse:</p>
        <img src="images/brainstorm-2.JPG">


        <h3>Home Automation Research</h3>
        <p>Based on the initial brainstorming, I decided to research some existing products that allow for easy home automation.</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li><strong><a href="https://nest.com/thermostat/life-with-nest-thermostat/">Nest Theromstat</a></strong> learns your schedule and helps you save money by controlling your home's temperature.</li>
          <li><strong><a href="http://www2.meethue.com/en-us/">Hue</a></strong> allows you to personalize your space through customized lighting controlled wirelessly.</li>
          <li><strong><a href="http://revolv.com/">Revolv</a></strong> is a hub that allows you to control multiple devices (Nest, Hue, etc) from your phone.</li>
          <li><strong><a href="http://www.belkin.com/us/p/P-F7C030/">The WeMo Light Switch</a></strong> allows you to turn your lights on and off no matter where you are.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Aside from Hue, these products weren't focused on aesthetics. They were focused primarily on sustainibility.</p>

        <h3>Narrowing Down Features</h3>
        <img src="images/brainstorm-3.JPG">
        <p>Afterwards, I brainstormed possible features for Penthouse. These features would all be controlled by a central application on a smart phone device. I decided to settle on five to fit the theme of Penthouse:</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li><strong>Customizable Photos + Artwork: </strong>All frames in the hotel room would be screens. Guests can upload their own artwork or photography onto each frame.</li>
          <li><strong>Personalized Music Experience: </strong>The sound system would sync with the music player of your choice (Songza, Spotify, Pandora, iTunes, etc.) If more than one person is staying in the room, the playlists would merge.</li>
          <li><strong>Ambient Lighting: </strong>The lighting will change according to the time zone you are traveling from to help you get accustomed to the new environment.</li>
          <li><strong>Temperature: </strong>Based on your home town's temperature, the temperature of the room would adjust to what you're most comfortable with.</li>
          <li><strong>Tailored Cuisine: </strong>Room service would be completely accessible on your device. Based on orders from previous stays, these dishes along with similar ones will appear at the top of the list.</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="headline">
        <h1 class="section-header">The Product</h1>
      </div>
      
      <div class="details">

        <h3 class="first">Sketches</h3>
        <p>Before creating a prototype, I did some quick sketches to gage how I wanted the basic app to work.</p>
        <img src="images/sketch-1.JPG">
        <img src="images/sketch-2.JPG">
        <img src="images/sketch-3.JPG">

        <h3 class="first">Wireframes</h3>
        <p>Using the features above, I created basic wireframes using Illustrator to demonstrate the concept and simple interactions. Pink circles shapes are all finger taps.</p>

        <img src="images/wireframes/wireframe-1.png">
        <p class="small">The background is a live camera view of the room. On the right side navigation, the user can edit their music playlist, order room service, and control the room temperature. The app will remember your past settings if you have used the application before.</p>

        <img src="images/wireframes/wireframe-2.png">
        <p class="small">The user taps the star. Stars allow users to interact with different objects in their vicinity.</p>

        <img src="images/wireframes/wireframe-3.png">
        <p class="small">This interface allows a guest to select a painting or photo to replace the current artwork.</p>

        <img src="images/wireframes/wireframe-4.png">
        <p class="small">The guest will get live previews of the changes. Image choices can come from the guest's camera roll or free online resources.</p>

        <img src="images/wireframes/wireframe-5.png">
        <p class="small">The guest taps the light source.</p>

        <img src="images/wireframes/wireframe-6.png">
        <p class="small">The pink marks demonstrate a hand gesture that would be overlayed on the live view. To increase a lamp's brightness, the guest can swipe upward. To dim a lamp, the guest can swipe downward.</p>

        <img src="images/wireframes/wireframe-7.png">
        <p class="small">To start a music playlist, the guest presses the music icon on the top right corner.</p>

        <img src="images/wireframes/wireframe-8.png">
        <p class="small">They can choose the music library (Spotify, Google Play, Pandora, Songza, etc.) they want to listen to.</p>

        <img src="images/wireframes/wireframe-9.png">
        <p class="small">Based on their choice, the interface displays their latest playlist.</p>

        <img src="images/wireframes/wireframe-10.png">
        <p class="small">The guest can either play this playlist or choose a different one.</p>

        <img src="images/wireframes/wireframe-11.png">
        <p class="small">After selecting a playlist, the "Current Song" will be displayed at the bototm of the view.</p>

        <h3>High-Fidelity Prototype</h3>
        <p>For the high-fidelity protoype, I created initial few screens of the design. Using Keynote, I created animations for transitions between different states of the application. The main feature displayed here is the interface for changing artwork on the walls. Photos can be taken from the guest's phone or from open source libraries on the internet.</p>
        <iframe width="100%" height="400px" style="margin-top: 10px;margin-bottom: 25px;" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/qV_Kv_2_4kw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <p>Below I've outlined some screens in detail:</p>
        <img src="images/prototype/1.png">
        <p class="small">When the guest enters the app, they are greeted by a few questions to help better personalize their experience.</p>

        <img src="images/prototype/2.png">
        <p class="small">After the guest enters their city, a photo of the city replaces the background.</p>

        <img src="images/prototype/3.png">
        <p class="small">After entering some basic information, the guest is given a small tutorial of how the app works. To engage with the room, the guest points his/her device at various objects in the room.</p>

        <img src="images/prototype/4.png">
        <p class="small">Stars are parts of the room that are customizable. The guest can touch any star to personalize that section of the space.</p>

        <img src="images/prototype/6.png">
        <p class="small">After clicking on the star above the painting, the guest can choose from a variety of photos and paintings to replace it. These photos and paintings could be pulled from his/her photo library or the internet.</p>

        <p>Aside from the artwork in the room, this interface would ideally work for the lighting and speakers as well.</p>

        <h1 class="section-header">Next Steps</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="details">
        <p>For the future, I would test my prototypes with various users. Based on the user testing, I would make changes to better the product.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Because Penthouse has a number of features, I would also try to condense the features to make them more cohesive. The current features all seem beneficial to the user, but they also span a wide range of tasks and areas.</p>
