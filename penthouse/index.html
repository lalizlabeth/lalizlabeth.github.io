      </div>
      <div class="details">
        <p>Many hotel chains have loyalty programs to reward travelers who routinely stay with them. Penthouse aims to give these travelers a special, personalized experience.</p>

        <h3>Target Group</h3>
        <p>Our target users are frequent hotel stayers. These are some possible occupations that require traveling:</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Business People</li>
          <li>Globe Trotters</li>
          <li>Fashion Industry</li>
          <li>Reporters</li>
          <li>Consulting</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Initial Brainstorming</h3>
        <p>I tried to come up with different ways people define their own space. Most of the ideas fit into the category of aesthetics and taste. In a dorm room, for example, it's easy to define each roommate's personal space based on posters and photos.</p>
        <img src="images/brainstorm-1.JPG">

        <p>Based on these observations, I tried to come up with a few words that would capture the style, look, and feel of the entire experience. As the program would be a reward for frequent travelers, I thought that it should have a sense of luxury or exclusiveness. These words also led to the name Penthouse:</p>

        <h3>Home Automation Research</h3>
        <p>Based on the initial brainstorming, I decided to research some existing products that allow for easy home automation.</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li><strong><a href="https://nest.com/thermostat/life-with-nest-thermostat/">Nest Theromstat</a></strong> learns your schedule and helps you save money by controlling your home's temperature.</li>
          <li><strong><a href="http://www2.meethue.com/en-us/">Hue</a></strong> allows you to personalize your space through customized lighting controlled wirelessly.</li>
          <li><strong><a href="http://revolv.com/">Revolv</a></strong> is a hub that allows you to control multiple devices (Nest, Hue, etc) from your phone.</li>
          <li><strong><a href="http://www.belkin.com/us/p/P-F7C030/">The WeMo Light Switch</a></strong> allows you to turn your lights on and off no matter where you are.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Aside from Hue, these products weren't focused on aesthetics. They were focused primarily on sustainibility.</p>

        <h3>Narrowing Down Features</h3>
        <img src="images/brainstorm-3.JPG">
        <p>Afterwards, I brainstormed possible features for Penthouse. These features would all be controlled by a central application on a smart phone device. I decided to settle on five to fit the theme of Penthouse:</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li><strong>Customizable Photos + Artwork: </strong>All frames in the hotel room would be screens. Guests can upload their own artwork or photography onto each frame.</li>
          <li><strong>Personalized Music Experience: </strong>The sound system would sync with the music player of your choice (Songza, Spotify, Pandora, iTunes, etc.) If more than one person is staying in the room, the playlists would merge.</li>
          <li><strong>Ambient Lighting: </strong>The lighting will change according to the time zone you are traveling from to help you get accustomed to the new environment.</li>
          <li><strong>Temperature: </strong>Based on your home's temperature, </li>
          <li><strong>Tailored Cuisine: </strong>Room service would be completely accessible on your device. Based on orders from previous stays, these dishes along with similar ones will appear at the top of the list.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Using the features above, I created basic wireframes to demonstrate the concept and simple interactions.</p>
