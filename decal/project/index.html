          <h1>Projects</h1>
          <p>All assignments are submitted through Behance. These will be graded based on completion and effort. The final project will be to create a portfolio showcasing all your work.</p>
          <h2><a href="https://www.behance.net/collection/Assignment-1-Repetition/18714331"><strong>Assignment 1:</strong> Repetition </a>- Due: February 11 at 11:59pm</h2>
          <p class="small">Design a postcard(s) for your favorite city, fictional or real. The postcard(s) must express the theme of repetition. You can create as many postcards as you wish as long as they all connect with each other. Your postcards should be 4in by 6in.</p>

          <p class="small">Upload your assignment to your Behance and add @innod-decal as a collaborator. Put a brief explanation for each postcard.</p>

          <h2><a href="https://www.behance.net/collection/Assignment-2-Alien-Contact/18959999"><strong>Assignment 2:</strong> Alien Contact </a>- Due: February 18 at 11:59pm</h2>

          <p class="small">The human race has discovered life on another planet, and NASA has been assigned the job of making first contact with this alien race. Create a piece of communication that is a ‘first point of contact’ or a ‘hello’ card if you like. The piece can be printed, digital or whatever you feel would be best as an introduction to planet Earth. Funny, serious, welcoming, threatening – it’s up to you.</p>
          <p class="small" style="text-align: right;"><em> - Taken from Carl Rush the Creative Director at Crush Creative</em></p>

          <p class="small">Please document your design process (brainstorming, photos of sketches, and multiple iterations if applicable). Upload your assignment to your Behance and add @innod-decal as a collaborator.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2><strong>Assignment 3:</strong> <a href="https://www.behance.net/collection/Assignment-3-Inanimate-Emotions/19184489">Inanimate Emotions</a> - Due: February 25 at 11:59pm</h2>

          <p class="small">Choose an inanimate object (chair, cupcake, telephone, etc.) and illustrate it. Make three copies of that object and color each a different way so that each panel represents a different emotion (happiness, anger, confusion, etc.). Do not edit the paths or add additional shapes. Do not put the emotion explicitly within the image because we’ll try to guess each emotion during critique next week. Write a brief description of why and how you chose each color scheme.</p>


          <p class="small">Please document your design process (brainstorming, photos of sketches, and multiple iterations if applicable). Upload your assignment to your Behance and add @innod-decal as a collaborator. If necessary, also upload a high definition PDF/PNG version to Dropbox and link to it in your assignment.</p>

          <h2><strong>Assignment 4:</strong> Book  - Due: February 25 at 11:59pm</h2>

          <p class="small">Choose a book of your choice. Redesign the first page of the novel. Use a grid as you see fit and only use one typeface. Feel free to incorporate graphics.</p>

          <p class="small">Please document your design process (brainstorming, photos of sketches, and multiple iterations if applicable). Upload your assignment to your Behance and add @innod-decal as a collaborator. If necessary, also upload a high definition PDF/PNG version to Dropbox and link to it in your assignment.</p>
