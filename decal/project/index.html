          <h2><strong>Assignment 1:</strong> Repetition- Due: Tuesday September 16 at 11:59pm</h2>
          <p class="small">Design a postcard(s) for your favorite fictional city or world. The postcard(s) must express the theme of repetition. You can create as many postcards as you wish as long as they all connect with each other. Your postcards should be 4in by 6in.</p>

          <p class="small">Design an advertisement to encourage students between the ages of K-12 to wash their hands in the bathroom. The important part of this assignment is to show your design process!</p>

          <h2><strong>Assignment 3:</strong> Trio of Emotions- Due: Tuesday September 29 at 11:59pm</h2>
          <p class="small">Choose an inanimate object (chair, cupcake, telephone, etc.) and illustrate it. Make three copies of that object and color each a different way so that each panel represents a different emotion (happiness, anger, confusion, etc.). Do not edit the paths or add additional shapes. Do not put the emotion explicitly within the image because weâ€™ll try to guess each emotion during critique next week. Write a brief description of why and how you chose each color scheme.</p>

          <p class="small">Upload your assignment to your Behance and add @innod-decal (Innovative Design DeCal) as a collaborator.</p>
