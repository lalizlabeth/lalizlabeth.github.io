        <h1>Color Theory</h1>
        <p>Here are <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/hn4xzokgjggtiqj/Color%20Theory.pdf">the slides</a> from class</p>
        <a href="http://thumbnails.visually.netdna-cdn.com/what-colors-mean-in-different-cultures_50290a647f1f2.png"><img src="http://thumbnails.visually.netdna-cdn.com/what-colors-mean-in-different-cultures_50290a647f1f2.png" width="100%"></a>
        
        <p>Color meanings vary per culture. This infographic shows how colors are mapped to different emotions depending on the culture. Death, for example, is represented by black in Western American cultures and white in Chinese cultures. Red is associated with good luck (e.g. red packets) in Chinese cultures while green is associated with good luck (e.g. four leaf clovers) in Western/American culture. Other emotions and colors are more universal. Passion is widely represented as red while evil is usually associated with black.</p>
        
        <h3>Colors &amp; Logos</h3>
        <p>Graphic designer, Paula Rupolo swapped the color schemes of competing brands' logos to demonstrate the importance of color in branding. You can read an article about it at <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/3020636/how-much-does-color-define-a-logo">FastCoDesign</a>.</p>

        <h3>Colors in Western/American Culture</h3>
        <h4>Red</h4>
        <p class="small"><em>Hot, Fire, Violence, Importance, Passion</em></p>
        <p class="small">Red is probably the hardest color to execute, but also the most memorable. Itâ€™s scientifically proven to increase your heart rate and raise your blood pressure. Red also increases your metabolism and makes you want to eat more. In China, red has a very different meaning of prosperity and happiness. Red is generally used as an accent color because it is very dominating as a primary color.<p>
        <p class="small"><em>Famous logos: Coca-Cola, Target, Pinterest</em></p>

        <h4>Orange</h4>
        <p class="small"><em>Cheerful, Confidence, Creativity, Health, Vitality</em></p>
        <p class="small">Orange is a very warm and inviting color because it's not as harsh as red. Because orange can also be associated with the fruit, it is also associated with vitality and health. Orange can also represent the changing of seasons, so movement and change can also be represented through orange.<p>
        <p class="small"><em>Famous logos: Home Depot, Fanta</em></p>
