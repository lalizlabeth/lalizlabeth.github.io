        <h2>Lesson 2</h2>
        <h1>The Design Process</h1>

        <p>Graphic design is more than making pretty posters and eye-catching logos. In technical terms, graphic design is defined as: </p> 

        <q>The art and profession of selecting and arranging visual elements—such as typography, images, symbols, and colours—to convey a message to an audience.</q>

        <p>It’s not that simple. Graphic design is about understanding people to make a difference in their everyday lives.</p>

        <h3>Case Study: <a href="http://blog.f-i.com/usatoday-com-redesigning-one-of-americas-most-popular-news-site/">USA Today Redesign</a></h3>

        <h3>1. Define the Problem</h3>
        <p>Before you start brainstorming or sketching, be sure you understand the problem you are trying to solve. If a client tells you, "We need a new logo and color palette for our restaurant," you should always understand why. Questions like the following can help you narrow the scope of your ideas. Examples of problems are:</p>
        <li>Sales have dropped 20% over the past year. What should we do?</li>
        <li>Our signage is hard to read, should we redo it?</li>
        <li>Less people are following us on Twitter, how should we get more followers?</li>

        <h3>2. Brainstorming</h3>
        <p><em>Adapted from The Creative Workshop</em></p>
        <li>Quantity over quality. You can filter ideas later.</li>
        <li>Brainstorming works best in groups!</li>
        <li><strong>Mind Mapping: </strong> Start with a central key idea in the center of the page. Expand on this idea by writing words related to this key insight in the empty space around the center, radiating outward.</li>
        <li><strong>Word Listing: </strong> On a sheet of paper, make three columns. In the first column, write as many concepts or terms related to your point of focus for the design. In the second column, pick an idea that interests you from the first column and rite down a series of words related to it. In the third colun, write down words that are opposite of the material you included in one. Circle + connect relationships that span columns one through three.</li>
        <li><strong>Idea Inversion: </strong> Take a concept that's not working and envision its exact opposite. Write out the opposing attributes, and draw that new idea. Compare the new idea to what you started with. Mix and match elements from both.</li>
        
        <h3>3. Evaluating Ideas</h3>
        <p><em>Make sure to build time into your idea generation process to evaluate your ideas. The SCAMPER technique synthesis checklist wa suggested by Alex Osborn.</em></p>
        <li><strong>Substitute something:</strong> What can I substitute to make an improvement? What if I swap this for that and see what happens? How can I substitute the place, time, materials or people?</li>
        <li><strong>Combine it with something else:</strong> What materials, features, processes, people, products or components can I combine?</li>
        <li><strong>Adapt something to it:</strong> What part of the product could I change? And in exchange for what? What if I were to change the characteristics of a component?</li>
        <li><strong>Modify or Magnify it:</strong> What happens if I warp or exaggerate a feature or component? What will happen if I modify the process in some way?</li>
        <li><strong>Put it to some other use:</strong> What other market could I use this product in? Who or what else might be able to use it?</li>
        <li><strong>Eliminate something:</strong> What would happen if I removed a component or part of it? How else would I achieve the solution without the normal way of doing it?</li>
        <li><strong>Reverse or Rearrange it:</strong> What if I did it the other way round? What if I reverse the order it is done or the way it is used? How would I achieve the opposite effect?</li>
