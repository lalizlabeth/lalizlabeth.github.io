        <h2>Lesson 2</h2>
        <h1>The Design Process</h1>

        <p>Graphic design is more than making pretty posters and eye-catching logos. In technical terms, graphic design is defined as: </p> 

        <q>The art and profession of selecting and arranging visual elements—such as typography, images, symbols, and colours—to convey a message to an audience.</q>

        <p>It’s not that simple. Graphic design is about understanding people to make a difference in their everyday lives.</p>

        <h3>Case Study: <a href="http://blog.f-i.com/usatoday-com-redesigning-one-of-americas-most-popular-news-site/">USA Today Redesign</a></h3>

        <h3>1. Define the Problem</h3>
        <p>Before you start brainstorming or sketching, be sure you understand the problem you are trying to solve. If a client tells you, "We need a new logo and color palette for our restaurant," you should always understand why. Questions like the following can help you narrow the scope of your problem.</p>
        <li>What is the goal?</li>
        <li>Are there any visual stylistic requirements?</li>
        <li>What physical limitations are imposed?</li>
        <li>When is the solution needed?</li>

        <h3>2. Research</h3>
        <p>After identifying the problem, it's important to do some research to better understand who/what you are designing for. For example, if the design challenge were to create a poster to motivate students to conserve water, talking to a range of students would definitely help you create a better, more effective design. Talking to your audience will help you assess how you want them to feel.</p>

        <p>Some designers use their research to create character archetypes who define their client base. Each archetype has a set goal and characteristics. These goals and characterstics remind designers that they are designing for someone else and not just themselves.</p>

        <h3>3. Brainstorming</h3>
        <p><em>Adapted from The Creative Workshop</em></p>
        <li>Quantity over quality. You can filter ideas later.</li>
        <li>Brainstorming works best in groups!</li>
        <li><strong>Mind Mapping: </strong> Start with a central key idea in the center of the page. Expand on this idea by writing words related to this key insight in the empty space around the center, radiating outward.</li>
        <li><strong>Word Listing: </strong> On a sheet of paper, make three columns. In the first column, write as many concepts or terms related to your point of focus for the design. In the second column, pick an idea that interests you from the first column and rite down a series of words related to it. In the third colun, write down words that are opposite of the material you included in one. Circle + connect relationships that span columns one through three.</li>
        <li><strong>Idea Inversion: </strong> Take a concept that's not working and envision its exact opposite. Write out the opposing attributes, and draw that new idea. Compare the new idea to what you started with. Mix and match elements from both.</li>

        <h3>4. Evaluating Ideas</h3>
        <p><em>Make sure to build time into your idea generation process to evaluate your ideas. The SCAMPER technique synthesis checklist wa suggested by Alex Osborn.</em></p>
        <li><strong>Substitute something:</strong> What can I substitute to make an improvement? What if I swap this for that and see what happens? How can I substitute the place, time, materials or people?</li>
        <li><strong>Combine it with something else:</strong> What materials, features, processes, people, products or components can I combine?</li>
        <li><strong>Adapt something to it:</strong> What part of the product could I change? And in exchange for what? What if I were to change the characteristics of a component?</li>
        <li><strong>Modify or Magnify it:</strong> What happens if I warp or exaggerate a feature or component? What will happen if I modify the process in some way?</li>
        <li><strong>Put it to some other use:</strong> What other market could I use this product in? Who or what else might be able to use it?</li>
        <li><strong>Eliminate something:</strong> What would happen if I removed a component or part of it? How else would I achieve the solution without the normal way of doing it?</li>
        <li><strong>Reverse or Rearrange it:</strong> What if I did it the other way round? What if I reverse the order it is done or the way it is used? How would I achieve the opposite effect?</li>

        <h3>5. Sketching</h3>
        <p>After you've filtered your ideas, go ahead and start sketching! You can start sketching during the brainstorming phase as well. Sketching allows you to make mistakes and iterate frequently.</p>

        <h3>6. Concept Generation</h3>
        <p>Choose 2-3 of your favorite sketches and execute them! They don't have to be pixel perfect yet. Each of these concepts should have a unique story behind them.</p>

        <h3>7. Present &amp; Get Feedback</h3>
        <p>Present your concepts to your client and get their feedback!</p>

        <h3>8. Revise</h3>
        <p>Keep revising until both you and your client are pleased with the final result</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Note that the design process can vary per person. This is just a very general idea of how it can look! Remember that design is about the process, not a finished product :)</p>
        <hr>

        <h3>Timeboxing</h3>
        <p>Timeboxing allows you to plan your design process in short sprints and finish your design in the allotted amount of time! It's a good way to add structure to a creative process.</p>
