I wanted to apply this methodology to fashion runway images I had scraped from Vogue's database. This is the average of every runway model from the Spring 2019 runway generated with Open Frameworks:</p>

          <p className="large-paragraph medium-spacer-bottom col-5">Over the last couple years, the fashion industry has treated diversity and inclusion as a trend. Based on this image alone, it looks like the average of fashion hasn't actually changed. I applied the same approach to individual designers. Designers of color like Luar, Pyer Moss, and Telfar tended to have a darker-skinned average. Note that these brands also have unisex shows:</p>
          <p className="reflections col-2">Although the skintone averages are darker, the body type is still fairly tall and slim.</p>
