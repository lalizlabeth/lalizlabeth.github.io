          <p className="large-paragraph medium-spacer-bottom col-5">In 2014, a couple designers and I restructed the Khan Academy content library from the ground up. As part of the project, I designed a new global navigation. This navigation is used across all of Khan Academy and still mostly the same today!</p>
          <p className="reflections col-2">Around the same time, I had just attended an Edward Tufte class, so this solution was inspired by his philosophy to show  density.</p>

        <p className="large-paragraph medium-spacer-bottom col-5">Before, our navigation system was separated by domain, so it was difficult to see all our subject offerings. One of our goals was to surface all our subjects to flip the misconception that Khan Academy is only math.</p>

I took all our brand assets and developed it into a Figma library, so that it was easy for designers across the organization to have the latest brand resources.</p>

        <ul className="text-list medium-spacer-bottom col-5">
          <li><strong>Red</strong> was reserved for error states &amp; destructive actions. Previously, it was used in Arts  &amp; Humanities as an accent color.</li>
          <li><strong>Green</strong> was reserved for correctness in both exercises and UI. We used to have green in our logo, CTA's, and the Computing domain.</li>
          <li><strong>Blue</strong> was reserved for all things actionable: links and buttons. We wanted blue to be used very minimally on each page to draw attention to the most importnat CTA. Previously, blue was the primary  color for the Math domain.</li>
          <li><strong>Purple</strong> was a new color we introduced for the concept of Mastery. Mastery is calculated differently from raw correctness, so we wanted to choose a color that differeniated it from Green. Purple was the only color remaining that reached accessiblity guidelines and wasn't close to the rest of the core colors.</li>
